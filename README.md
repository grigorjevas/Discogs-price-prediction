# Discogs price prediction API
![Discogs](assets/discogs_logo.jpg)
## Introduction
Vinyl records - new or old - retain a lot of value and some of them turn out to be a good investment as their value 
increases over time. I have collected a dataset of 5000 Electro records from
[Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), the largest online music database and marketplace using my other project, 
[Discogs Marketplace scraper](https://github.com/grigorjevas/Discogs-marketplace-scraper) and trained a logistic 
regression model based on various features of the records.\
The model will predict the price for a provided record making it easier to decide whether it's a bargain and worthy 
addition to my collection, or overpriced meal for Discogs sharks.
